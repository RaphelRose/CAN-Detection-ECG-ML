# CAN-Detection-ECG-ML
Machine learning-based detection of Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN) in Type 2 Diabetes patients using ECG data.
This project implements a machine learning-based system for detecting **Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN)** in **Type 2 Diabetes** patients using **ECG data**. The system focuses on feature extraction from RR intervals and classification using ML algorithms such as XGBoost and Random Forest.
